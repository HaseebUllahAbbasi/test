            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>An MPPT, or maximum power point tracker is an electronic DC to DC converter that optimizes the match between the solar array (PV panels), and the battery bank or utility grid. To put it simply, they convert a higher voltage DC output from solar panels (and a few wind generators) down to the lower voltage needed to charge batteries.
                 Most PV panels are built to put out a nominal 12 volts. The catch is "nominal". In actual fact, almost all "12-volt" solar panels are designed to put out from 16 to 18 volts. The problem is that a nominal 12-volt battery is pretty close to an actual 12 volts - 10.5 to 12.7 volts, depending on state of charge. Under charge, most batteries want from around 13.2 to 14.4 volts to fully charge. So to cope with this problem, a charge controller is required.
                To work on this amazing project, Aneel Kumar & Muhammad Javed Worked in team and had a very vast learning experience under the supervision of respected Dr. Asim Samejo.</p>

            <h3>Design Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Our design requirement was that it should be as much compact as we can make it. Also, we must have main board and microcontroller board adjusted on each other. For that we had to make a main BCB board of MPPT Solar charge controller and a PCB board of Arduino Leonardo to control the main circuit.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Sample Image of Required Design</h3>
            <p>While designing the circuit, a rough sketch was needed so that we can refer to a particular design and idea. After thinking a lot on this, we came up with a sketch that our project should look like this.</p>

            <img src="./1.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Sample Image of Required Design">

            <p>Seeing this design we had in mind that in the enclosure will contain the PCB boards inside it and it will look presentable.</p>

            <h3 id="PEP">Project Execution Plan</h3>
            <p>Since it was a semester project, so we had 4 months to complete our project. We dived this duration into month wise work progress as in following pattern.</p>

            <img src="./3.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="High Level Design">
            <p>Voltage is coming from solar panel and is being fed to buck converter, voltage sensor and current sensor. Buck converter steps down the voltage. Leonardo board assigns the suitable voltage for charging of battery which is being fed by the buck converter. This information goes to the Leonardo board which then displays this info on LCD. We can connect load with this battery also.</p>

            <h3>PCB Schematics:</h3>
            <p>Now for designing PCB, we used Eagle software. The boards of micro-controller and of main circuit had to be designed separately. 
                Those designs are given below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Arduino Leonardo Board</b></li>

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Troubleshooting we faced during Routing:</h3>
            <p>Having schematic of controller board and main Board separately, 
                when we started to route our boards, the first issue we faced was that how 
                should we route two boards in a way that we can connect them easily, so what 
                we do was that we used two connectors to connect controller board with main board 
                in a way that main board is placed on controller board. The next thing that troubled us was how route these two boards, so after routing and derouting the board around 4 to 5 times, we got a direction and started to route controller board by taking reference to Atmega238P and connectors in main board. When we have routed many of components, one more issue we faced was the components that were left could have a possible path to route them, 
                so there we used resistors of 0 ohms to provide path to those components. </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <h3>PCB Layout:</h3>
            <p>After routing, we got our final PCB layouts. Those layouts are shown below:</p>

            <p>We were using bootloader connector which was connected to PC through USB port, 
                Then we opened the Arduino program and write the bootloader program there,
                 which was then uploaded to the controller board.</p>

            <p>Now that we built our micro-controller and successfully bootloaded it, so that was he time for testing.
                 We started with testing of LCD with a simple Hello World display program.</p>

            <p>After the successful testing of LCD ,now was the time to build our circuit 
                in a proper manner and then test it. </p>
                <img src="17.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="High Level Design">
             <p>Above picture shows the testing ofour main circuit with Arduino Leonardo. 
                 For running of Leonardo board, 5volts were needed. We gave 12volts and used
                  LM7805 voltage regulator which converts 5volts from 12volts. Another voltage 
                  regulator was used to convert 5volt into 3v3 volts which was used by LCD.
                   Another 12 volts were applied to circuit which was is requirement to run. 
                   For solar panel reference voltage, we used a variable power  supply and gave
                    17 volts to the circuit. 
                So, that’s how we implemented our main circuit

            <h3>Commercialization Aspects:</h3>
            <p>The MPPT Charge Controller can also be used as a BUSINESS MODEL as people in many far 
                flung areas are still deprived of the basic need of electricity, so if this charge 
                controller is used in these areas, it will help the people to at least use a bulb at 
                night or also they can used it for charging purposes of phones etc. Also, It can also 
                be sale to the companies who use batteries as there backup for electricity as this charge
                 controller will help them to increase the life of batteries. Also it is a cheap product
                  that everyone can 
                find it affordable as compared to other means of controlling battery systems.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>That was all  from us. A little effort to apply the knowledge we gained through this subject.
                In the end we want to express our gratitude to sir Asim Samejo for guiding us through all manners. From providing helping material to providing components to always having a visionary thought and for being always available for help.
                We also want to thank Mr. Aizaz Ali Larik and Mr. Nadir Ali for always being there for us. They helped us in every manner they could. Without the helping hands of these gentlemen, this project would have much more difficult and much more challenging for us.
