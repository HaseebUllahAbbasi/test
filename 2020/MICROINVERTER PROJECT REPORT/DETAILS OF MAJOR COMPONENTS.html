 <h3>Arduino UNO</h3><br>
  Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your Uno without worrying too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again. "Uno" means one in Italian and was chosen to mark the release of Arduino Software (IDE) 1.0. The Uno board and version 1.0 of Arduino Software (IDE) were the reference versions of Arduino, now evolved to newer releases. The Uno board is the first in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform; for an extensive list of current, past or outdated boards see the Arduino index of boards.</td>

 <h3>Hip 4082 (h- bridge controller)</h3><br>

<tr><td><br>The topology chosen uses the hip4082 to provide a 60khz, low voltage, square-wave to drive a small isolation power transformer. The output of this transformer is rectified, filtered, and the high voltage inverted again to produce the desired low frequency (55hz) output waveform. The HIP4082 peak output drive current is 1.25A, which reduces the need for adding series gate resistors when driving medium to large mosfets.The hip4082 provides continuous on/off level-shift drive signals for the upper mosfets. Proper dead-time adjustment avoids simultaneous mosfet conduction when switching from an upper mosfet to a lower mosfet or vice-versa.</td><td></td></tr></table>

<p>LEM LA 55P has been used to sense the currents.
Lem la55-p measures a.C. And D.C current up to 50A. 
To get an accurate value, the hall effect sensor is used. 
We use  lem current sensor (la-55p) because it is very precise and accurate which meets our requirement 

IS is positive when I P flows in the direction of the arrow. Temperature of the primary conductor should not exceed 90°C. Dynamic performances (di/dt and response time) are best with a single bar completely filling the primary hole. In order to achieve the best magnetic coupling, the primary windings have to be wound over the top edge of the device. This is a standard model. For different versions (supply voltages, turns ratios, unidirectional measurements...), please contact us.</td>

TOROIDAL TRANSFORMER


</b></h2>



</td>   </tr>

<tr><td>
<p>Toroidal transformers are transformers 
which use magnetic cores with a toroidal (ring or donut) shape. 
They are passive electronic components, consisting of a circular
 ring or donut shaped magnetic core of ferromagnetic material such
 as laminated iron, iron powder, or ferrite, around which wire is 
wound.

Although in the past, closed-core transformers often
 used cores with a square shape, the use of toroidal-shaped cores 
has increased greatly because of their superior electrical performance.
 The advantage of the toroidal shape is that, due to its symmetry, the 
amount of magnetic flux that escapes outside the core (leakage flux)
 is low, therefore it is more efficient and thus radiates less 
electromagnetic interference (EMI).

Toroidal transformers are used in a wide range of
 electronic circuits: power supplies, inverters, and amplifiers, 
which in turn are used in the vast majority of electrical equipment: 
TVs, radios, computers, and audio systems.</td>
