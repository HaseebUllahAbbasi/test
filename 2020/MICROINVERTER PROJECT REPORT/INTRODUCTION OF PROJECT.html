  <tr><td>Microinverter is a device that converts direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). Microinverters contrast with conventional string and central solar inverters, in which a single inverter is connected to multiple solar panels. The output from several microinverters can be combined and often fed to the electrical grid.<brbr>

The Micro inverter(μiv)that we gonna make, is an arduino-uno based dc-to-ac power converter.The μiv platform is meant for doing experiments with power electronics and energy systems. Dc-to-ac power inverter for off the grid applications,this takes input of 12v(dc) and gives output of 230v to 240v(ac) with 50 to 60 hz. We prefer μiv because it is simple to build and it is relatively safe to operate.</td>

      In  recent years the use of solar energy in domestic as well as at large scale has been increased exponentially. The reason of the use of the solar energy at the domestic level is that one can get rid of the load shedding as well as of the electricity bills. While at large scale the governments are trying to achieve the “Paris Agreement” goal of lowering the global average temperature up to 2 degree Celsius until the end of this century. The governments are focusing on the clean energy. So the new power plants are mostly the renewable which are environment friendly.

The solar power plants are one of the main sources of this renewable energy. The solar energy is generated in DC form. While the home appliances runs on the AC electricity. Here the DC to AC converter is required. The more is the number of solar power plants, the more is the demand of the inverters.
