<ul>
<li>It is famous proverb that person always learn from its mistakes and hardships.<br>
It is irony that most of the time we learn from our mistakes and complication we face while<br> 
doing some work or task. Same is the case of our project, while making project we face multiple complications<br> and made multiple mistakes which lead to lifelong learning. One of the most common problem we<br> faced while doing work on solid works is regarding measurements, in start we are unable to imagine what <br>will be the correct size of the design we are making and which is the perfect measurements of our design <br>as a result, our first design failed.<br> After Working on measurements, accuracy and precision we better<br> and accurate design of different parts of<br> our project ventilator which helped in better performance of our project
After solid work the 2nd most complicated<br> part of our project was assembly. We did assembling of project multiple times as few parts of our project<br> has not been designed properly which lead to the irregular assembling. After working on designs we<br> overcame this problem easily.
After doing assembly 1st time we realized that our pusher and belt mount<br> is not able to move properly and there is a lot of stiffness in the in movement due to lack of<br> knowledge. So after doing our research that how can we reduce this stiffness and after connecting our<br> supervisor we add linear bearings in in belt mount part which reduced the stiffness of motion and reduced<br> friction.
In assembly of our project the most difficult part was to mount timing belt properly as it<br> would not restrict the motion of pusher as a result it would not able to push ambu bag properly. We<br> designed various part to join the end of the timing belt but it didn’t help us and also restricted <br>the motion. In the end we design belt mount in such a way that it would not only join both ends of the <br>timing belt but would also  provide enough friction for the movement of the pusher to push ambu bag.</li><br></center>
