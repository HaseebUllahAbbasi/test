              At the start of semester when list of projects were offered. Oxygen concentrator captured our attention because of shortage of mdeical oxygen was all over the news. Keeping COVID-19 and its impacts on the whole world, lack of pure oxygen and worsening of the situation everyday, it serves a great purpose in tackling the situation in a very clean and neat way. </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              <!-- This whole paragraph was taken from: 
                https://pharmeasy.in/blog/oxygen-concentrators-how-are-they-helping-the-covid-19-patients/ 
              -->
              As the whole world is grappling with the Coronavirus pandemic,
              people are running from pillar to post to arrange hospitals, ICU
              beds, life-saving medications, ventilators and most importantly
              ‘oxygen’, to save their loved ones. Arranging these basic
              necessities is so tough today because the availability of all
              these things is way less than what the country requires to win
              this battle. In these testing times, Oxygen Concentrators have
              turned out to be a ‘saviour’ for the people who are mildly
              affected with COVID-19 and are trying to recover in home
              isolation, owing to the shortage of hospital beds.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              Its importance can be taken into account from its portability and the fact that it can save of patients in critical care. Portable
              pure oxygen was once considered to be almost impossible for many individuals before, but today, the reality is changing almost
              every individual's life.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              Since the project is education-based only, thus, we opted for major factors only and omitting the minor ones to make our
              learning more useful.

              Its function is to produce highly concentrated oxygen at the
              output.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              At the start of the project did not have any priori knowledge about different types of concentrators. With the help of our teacher we started exploring the pressure swing absorption (PSA) technique. PSA technique  has several tanks filled with oxygen filtering material when air is pumped into such tanks oxygen passes through the filter material while nitrogen and other impurities are left behind. In this process multiple tanks are used while one tank is being pumped with air other tanks flusho out the impurities.

            The above execution plan was made accordingly. Keeping in mind the fact that the major portion of the project was mechanical. We

            We chose the pipes with 6-inch diameter and 20-inch height and the
            quality of the pipe was such that they could withstand the pressure
            of almost 5 bars. The purity of the oxygen at the output will be
            approximately 80-85 percent of the total oxygen (27 percent) due to
            the fact that the air contains 80 percent of Nitrogen, the
            compression of the air into our tanks and that the components were
            educational and not commercial, thus, the purity will be not as much
            as required for the usage.

              From this picture, we got to understand our project alot better

            <p class="p-desc">
              We tried our best to understand the schematic diagram as a whole,
              however, as we went on understanding it, we were introduced to
              some components which were totally new to us.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              One of the things was solenoid valves. We took our time to
              understand that particular component. It is one of the main
              factors to control the flow of the fluid to the tanks
              alternatively.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              The valves can be controlled through a famous micro-controller
              known as Arduino. The coding was simple and the valves were given
              switching time of 5 seconds.

              Although a commercial PSA concentrator is a very complex device involving various air filters, flow and pressure sensors; we simplified the diagram considerably to reduce the complexity and cost of the project.  
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              Our main goal was to design and construct such a project that uses Zeolite material to filter out oxygen from other unnecessary gases
              from the provided air.<br />Thus, we used two tanks, a portable air compressor, two way solenoid valves, arduino to make our implementation of PSA concentrator.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              Zeolite is a very pourous material, which is mainly used to absorb moisture. Special type of zeolite can be used to separate Oxygen from air. This is a simple and cost-effective way to purify oxygen.

              Compressed air is fed into each of the filter tanks one by one through switching of solenoid values. The switching of solenoid valve is controlled through micro-controller programming.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              Since micro-controller works with 5VDC and very limited current, micro-controller on its own can not operate Solenoid Valves. The valves can be controlled via relay. Since our device contains 4 valves we will be needing a 4-channel relay to control all the valves individually.
            </p>
            <p class="p-desc">
              The zeolite material inside the tanks would filter out the unnecessary gases and provide us with a pure oxygen at the output,
              which would then be given to the patient, simultaneously, the pressure at the input would be extracted out through the valves
              since the inner pressure would less than the atmospheric pressure.

            <p class="p-desc">
              Since the air compressor operates at 12 VDC, Solenoid valves operate at 24 VDC  and micro-controller board  operates 5VDC we had to incorporate 3 different power supplies to operate the system.

              If the final prototype is once run, the air compressor will produce an impure air and the tanks will take that air as input
              alternatively through T-shape. For 5 seconds, one of the tanks  will take the whole air and produce pure oxygen at the output and
              for other 5 seconds, the other tank shall be getting filled while from the first one, input pressure shall be extrated out
              automatically through the input valve.
			  
			  After assembly of parts, fitting of pipe and wiring we were finally ready to turn on the switch. Quite a few problems came to light. First and fore most the throughput of air compressor was not enough to fill up the tank rapidly. We also felt that our make shift tank was not air tight thus pressure was not building up as quickly as we would have wanted.

              This project helped us learn a lot about micro-controllers, electronic valves as well as relay. Through relay, we learned how
              to switch things based on our necessacities. Furthermore, we learned C & Assembly languages which were totally new to us.

              Most of the time, when we got obstacles, we surfed the internet thoroughly and we roughly got to know about that particular
              obstacle. Thus, we had to manage things on our own.
			  Execution of this semeser project was a quite different experience for us. Right from the start of the project we had to review review the literature to fully understand the PSA Concentrators. Once we got underway we had to refer to many  online toturials to understand the operation of various components such as solenoid value, relays and how to control them through a micro-controller

              Although there is abundant set of resources available on the internet. We found  <a href="https://helpfulengineering.org/projects-news/project-spotlight-apollo-oxygen-concentrator/" target="_blank">Project Apollo</a>
              particularly useful as a starting point. This project also has a repository at 
              <a href="https://github.com/oxycon/ProjectApollo" target="_blank"> Github </a>   and from there, we came to know how our project would actually work and its design.
